This SVN comes with all the files needed to get on
Tux's Serious RP Server swiftly and with ease!
You don't need to have these files to play, but it is SERIOUSLY recommended!

Having these files allows you to quickly log-on to the server and immediately have fun!


**You WILL need to have PCmod2 & Wire if you want to get on quickly! These two addons are updated frequently and need to have their own SVN.**

The Admins and Staff of the Server will be listed in this group. We are currently looking for Admins! To interview for the job, please e-mail me at: Alphanani@gmail.com
We would like to see you join!

If you would like to review the code, go on ahead! If you would like to maybe see something changed please post in the Issues Tab above! I won't change everything, but if you know how to do something and I don't I will gladly change the code!
